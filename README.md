*An accessible alternative to HTML5 CSS resets*

GDCSS styles all visible HTML elements in line with modern best practice.
It focusses only on HTML tags so you can just write HTML (no classes or frameworks).

GDCSS is aimed at projects needing to blast out some HTML quickly and turn it into a deployable prototype or site without any other CSS being needed, but also not getting in the way if that is the case.

[Read the docs](https://hawkz.github.io/gdcss/docs.html).

* Live demo of current master: https://latest.datasette.io/

## Installation
Just add the CSS file to the `<head>` of your HTML.

    <link href="https://hawkz.github.io/gdcss/gd.css" rel="stylesheet">

That's it! simple HTML now becomes a visually accessible page.
